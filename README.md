# A Javascript Drum Machine - Single Page App

This is a single page web app built to function as a drum machine and pass a series of tests from the freecodecamp.org Front End Development Libraries Certification:
https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator

It takes input of the keys pressed and plays the stored sound.

It also stores this sound in sequence that can be played back with the play button.

You can use the sliders to adjust playback speed and volume.
